## 🗄️ Database

**Powered by Expo SQLite**  

**Table: supplies**  

**Columns:**  
- id (PK)  
- skey (stable key)  
- label (display name)  
- intervalDays (when to replace)  
- lastReplaced (date)  
- notifyHour + notifyMinute (bedtime notifications)  
- notificationId (tracks scheduled reminder)  
- snoozedUntil (future feature)  

Auto-seeds defaults on first run

## 🔔 Notifications

Uses **expo-notifications**  
- Scheduled local notifications only (no remote push yet)  
- Notifications are canceled + re-scheduled automatically when:  
  - A reminder is edited  
  - A supply is replaced  
  - A reminder is deleted  

⚠️ Note: Expo Go has limitations — use a development build for full notification support.
